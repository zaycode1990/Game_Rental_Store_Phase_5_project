User Story:
upon arriving to site you land on the login , when not logged in you can not add games to cart when in games tab and most features are not attainable. When logged in, you can add game to cart and delete games from cart. You can checkout games and your information and games you rented will persist to the server. Also on the game cards in the game checkout you can click on a link to a review page where you can leave a review which also persists to the server. When logged in as an admin you can delete games , update games, and add games to the server. 
Later I'd like to present a receipt for the user so they see their games, i also would like the admin to see every user that has a game and how long they've had the game. I also would like to have functionality that shows all reviews to user.
